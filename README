= Deadlock Retry

Deadlock retry allows the PostgreSQL adapter to retry transactions that fall into deadlock. It will retry
such transactions three times before finally failing.

This capability is automatically added to ActiveRecord. No code changes or otherwise are required.

== Installation

Add it to your Rails application by including a reference to it in your application's Gemfile:

  gem 'pg_deadlock_retry', git: 'git://github.com/TimothyKlim/pg_deadlock_retry.git'
